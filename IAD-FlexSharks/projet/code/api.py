# Login
##############################
# The client sends the login email using a URL parameter (e.g.
# /login?email=john.doe@gmx.com), and the API returns the corresponding user ID
# or an error string if login fails.
# GET is used because even though we are sending user information, since
# semantically, the intent is to "GET" a user ID.
# 
# This API call entirely disregards any notion of security when it comes to
# login. While a production application may be run with SSL (in which case the
# URL parameters would be encrypted since SSL resides between the TCP and HTTP
# layers), a more typical approach would involve getting a token (decorrelated
# from the user name / id) or a HMAC-based mechanism, or a even a two-step
# challenge mechanism.
# 
# Using a URL parameter allows us to easily scale the parameters account to any
# new authentication method.

# Book a ticket
##############################

# indicates the intention to modify a specific "ticket" ressource.
# 
# Given the potentially concurrent nature of API calls, it is necessary to take
# into account the possibility of two clients wanting to book the same ticket
# at about that same time. In practice, client 1 and 2 would load the ticket
# list, and client 1 would book said ticket. Without a page refresh, client 2
# would still see the ticket available, and the API needs to be able to signify
# the client that this specific ticket isn't available for purchase anymore
# (whereupon the client would reload the list, displaying another ticket for
# the same flight -with a different id-, or nothing if none is left).
# 
# The same remark as above applies here about identification. We don't want
# just any client booking tickets as other clients.
